# Early-Prediction-of-Cardiac-Arrest-Using-Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Models

The prediction of cardiac arrest is a very hard job, it is basically predicted based on doctors' intutions and experiences, which results upto millions of deaths annually in India. I have developed this hybrid model of SVM and DT which work together to predict sudden cardiac arrest.
